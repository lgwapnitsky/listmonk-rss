## Setup

### 1. Local Setup

1. Fork this repository so that you can set up your own schedule and clone it.

2. Install dependencies using uv:
   ```bash
   uv sync -U
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file with your configuration:
   ```bash
   LISTMONK_API_USER=<your_api_user>
   LISTMONK_API_TOKEN=<your_api_token>
   LISTMONK_HOST=https://your.listmonk.instance
   LIST_NAME=<your_list_name>
   RSS_FEED=https://your.rss.feed/url
   DELAY_SEND_MINS=30
   ```

4. Test the script locally:
   ```bash
   make create_campaign
   ```

### 2. Pushover Notifications (Optional)

To receive notifications when newsletters are scheduled (this gives you an
  opportunity to review the content before it is sent out):

1. Create a Pushover account at https://pushover.net
2. Install the Pushover app on your devices
3. Get your User Key from the Pushover dashboard
4. Create an Application/API Token

### 3. GitHub Actions Setup

1. Add your `.env` file contents and Pushover credentials as GitHub Secrets in your repository:
   - Go to Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions
   - Add each environment variable as a new repository secret

2. The workflow is already configured in `.github/workflows/listmonk_rss.yml`
   - Runs on Weekdays at 8:00 UTC
   - Persists state between runs using GitHub repository variables
   - Automatically creates and schedules newsletters

3. To manually trigger the workflow:
   - Go to Actions â†’ Listmonk RSS
   - Click "Run workflow"

You should run the trigger manually for the first time so that the state can be
saved (make sure you delete the campaign on your Listmonk instance if you don't
want your subscribers to get an email with all existing items). Running the
workflow for the first time will show an error that it wasn't able to find the
artifact - that's expected.

## Configuration

- `items`: List of RSS feed items with:
  - `title`: Article title
  - `link`: Article URL
  - `summary`: Article summary
  - `media_content`: OpenGraph image URL


## Contributing

Contributions are welcome, but there's no guarantee that I will be able to act on them. I
use this mostly for my own purposes. My advice would be to fork it and
adjust it to your needs.
